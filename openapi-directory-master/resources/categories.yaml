# List of categories to be used in `x-apisguru-categories`.
#
# Intention is to have list of categories that can fitted as sidebar on a single page.
# With this constrain in mind we can't have ideal fit for each API, instead we
# choose approach of open-ended categories.
#
# Rules:
#  - categories names consist of following symbols 'a-z_'.
#  - for each category user-friendly title and description provided.
#  - removal of category is breaking change.
#
# Warning: Future addition of categories is possible, but it should be proven that
# significant amount of APIs don't fit any of existing categories.
